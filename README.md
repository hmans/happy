# Happy Ruby

**The Happy Web Application Toolkit for Ruby.**

## Introduction

Happy is a toolkit for developing web applications using Ruby. Inspired by both Sinatra and Rails, it sits somewhere in the middle, trying to offer the super-light-weight attitude and flexibility of Sinatra, the comfort and power of Rails, and adding a big chunk of extensibility and modularity that any lover of object-oriented application design will enjoy.

Furthermore, the way Happy handles incoming requests is vastly different from how most of the other frameworks do it, offering a new, extremely flexible and suspiciously fun way of building your application.

## Installing

Happy is available as a RubyGem, so just install it through `gem install happy` (or add it to your project's `Gemfile`. You know the drill.)

## Usage

* [The Happy Book of Happy](http://rdoc.info/github/hmans/happy/master/file/TUTORIAL.md)

## Reporting Bugs & Contributing

* [Issues on Github](https://github.com/hmans/happy/issues)

I am trying to keep Happy's code base as sane (and small) as possible. If you
want to contribute code, _please_ talk to me _before_ writing a patch or submitting
a pull request! Thank you.
